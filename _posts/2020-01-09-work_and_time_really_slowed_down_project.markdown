Moving to a new state, taking a new job, and wrangling all the things you have to move really bogs down a project.

So while I was taking the time and focus on my life and career I read books.

Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby: An Agile Primer - Sadi Metz
The Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey to Mastery - Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas

Now after reading those, I can say I didn't learn how to make my project any better. But did learn that learning how to phrase and frame the question will get you closer to the answer. I also learned that no matter the amount of reading and videos you really can't always carry something over without just trial and error. 

The books are worth reading and have quite a lot tips in them for people who probably are further in this program.

So the project works for the most part and this is a pointless blog post nobody will read.
