Moving to a new state, taking a new job, and wrangling all the things you have to move really bogs down a project.

So while I was taking the time and focus on my life and career I read books.

Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby: An Agile Primer - Sadi Metz
The Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey to Mastery - Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas

Now after reading those, I can say I didn't learn how to make my project any better. But did learn that learning how to phrase and frame the question will get you closer to the answer. I also learned that no matter the amount of reading and videos you really can't always carry something over without just trial and error. 

The books are worth reading and have quite a lot tips in them for people who probably are further in this program.

[Updated 02/2020] So the project works for the most part and this is a pointless blog post nobody will read. I was asked by a person of this company to remove this line... One thing I can't stand is when someone attempts to control other people's expressions of frustration. 
I have been working on this for a month out of sync with the standard method this program provides, I have a full-time job and two separate consulting gigs so I don't get the freedom to take part in the Telcom study sessions. 

I will concede that I don't know how most of my project works as the first part was written 6 months prior to the other half. I spent hours watching videos and reading articles to get the first part working and then had to focus on other responsiblities. Come to work on the second half I used books I read during the busy times and a mountain more of videos and articles to complete the project with the desired functions. 
Do I remember how the first half works?
Yes and no.
Do I know how the second half works?
Yes very much so.
What do I think of the project as a whole?
Largely its garbage and not conforming to standards and practices of a real application. Not so much scaleability and updates to the logic are shotty at best. OOP takes practice and knowing much more than I did at the time.

Honestly, I have taken quite a bit about out of this program but I do consider dropping it for a company that is more interested in working with people.
