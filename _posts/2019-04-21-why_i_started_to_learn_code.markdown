This is very simple for me.

I wanted to actually have a job where i could make something new. I currently make things like classrooms, theaters and meeting spaces. Don't get me wrong thats rewarding and fun but its very finite, the building only has so much space and eventually i'll be done. Also they're basically clones...

I'm looking forward to making things that are alive and change as we go. Being able to work on something that keeps building the more effort you put into it.

Things i've been using to increase my productivity while working on the Flatiron content are

Engross on the play store

Can be used as a attention tracker and pomodoro timer.

Tiny Cards
