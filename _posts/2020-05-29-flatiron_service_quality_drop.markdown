So I've noticed that the service from Flatiron has dropped in quality. 

Seeing people with issues being redirected to 3rd party sources for help or given instructions without actually addressing or triage the issue for the user.

I have two unanswered tickets with Flatiron support and have helped quite a few Flatiron students by using my Uni Zoom account and fixing up MacOS problems for people. 

I guess I can thank Flatiron for helping me buildup my MacOS/Terminal troubleshooting skills, they don't come up in the enterprise environment I work in every day. 

Mostly I am growing dissatisfied with the quality of the service and curriculum, lessons riddled with typos, incoherent instructions, mismatched updates from the lab to the readme, extremely poor quality videos or broken links, unanswered flags on answers, overreliance on 3rd party links to give instruction or clarify what the lesson should be teaching and general apathy. In-browser support is clunky and has overwhelmed support staff answering multiple questions simultaneously causing increased wait times and multiple reps jumping in and out of support for an issue as one rep may be deep in conversation with other users and has to abandon the user they joined with. 

When I signed for this service it was billed as higher quality and "with you every step of the way"... not seeing or feeling that.

I've worked in IT and Higher Education since I was 18, feel free to contact me and start a dialog about these issues and feel free to ask about tips on how to handle large volume IT support for the support of students. 

Other than that I'll keep chewing away the work until someone answers my tickets.
