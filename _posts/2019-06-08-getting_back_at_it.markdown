Wow nothing derails you like a huge work project. 

So after a massive project takes all your life force how do you get back on tracking learning a bunch of random short words and syntax?

First download Toggl this will allow you track your progress for things like Flatiron, day-job, and screwing around.

then establish fitness and diet. both can be facilitated by https://darebee.com/

Then just working around the various things life throws at you. 

checking out videos about the curriculum and checking for tips on Dev.to
