I am over 30 days into the Flatiron curriculum and I have new found respect for the issues that seem to popup in programs. 

I have made many mistakes be it typos, syntax failures, or my favorite not reading the error correctly. 
I’ve learned I need to not only type slower… but read slower. So many times, I’ve been working on something and I could have moved on if only I read the error and noticed the missing comma….
Each exercise is a part to a much larger puzzle that haven’t even got to touch yet. 

Still having fun though
